## Anchore Engine Overview

### What is Anchore Engine?

In short: a system to help automate the description and enforcement of requirements on the content of docker containers.

With a bit more detail? Anchore Engine is a docker container static analysis and policy-based compliance tool that automates the inspection, analysis, and evaluation of images against user-defined checks to allow high confidence in container deployments by ensuring workload content meets the required criteria. Anchore Engine ultimately provides a policy evaluation result for each image: pass/fail against policies defined by the user. Additionally, the way that policies are defined and evaluated allows the policy evaluation itself to double as an audit mechanism that allows point-in-time evaluations of specific image properties and content attributes.

### How does it work?


Anchore takes a data-driven approach to analysis and policy enforcement. The system essentially has discrete phases for each image analyzed:

1. **Fetch** the image content and extract it, but never execute it
2. **Analyze** the image by running a set of Anchore analyzers over the image content to extract and classify as much metadata as possible
3. **Save** the resulting analysis in the database for future use and audit
5. **Evaluate** policies against the analysis result, including vulnerability matches on the artifacts discovered in the image
Update to the latest external data used for policy evaluation and vulnerability matches (we call this external data sync a feed sync), and automatically update image analysis results against any new data found upstream.
6. **Notify** users of changes to policy evaluations and vulnerability matches
7. **Repeat** 5 & 6 on intervals to ensure latest external data and updated image evaluations

The primary interface is a RESTful API that provides mechanisms to request analysis, policy evaluation, and monitoring of images in registries as well as query for image contents and analysis results. We also provide a CLI and its own container.

There are, generally speaking, two different ways to use Anchore Engine, within its single API:

1. Interactive Mode - Use the APIs to explicitly request an image analysis, get a policy evaluation and content reports, but the engine only performs operations when specifically requested by a user
2. Watch Mode - Use the APIs to configure Anchore Engine to poll specific registries and repositories/tags to watch for new images added and automatically pull and evaluate them, emitting notifications when a given tag's vulnerability or policy evaluation state changes

With these two modes of operation, integration into CI/CD with Interative Mode or less intrusive watching of production image repositories with Watch Mode, Anchore Engine can be easily integrated into most environments and processes.

### How to get it?

Anchore Engine is [open source](https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine), and we build and deliver it as a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/anchore/anchore-engine).

The system is a collection of services that can be deployed co-located or fully distributed or anything in-between, and as such it can scale out to increase analysis throughput. The only external system required is a PostgreSQL database (9.6+) that all service connect to, but do not use for communication beyond some very simple service registration/lookup processes. The database is centralized simply for ease of management and operation.

The six services that comprise the Engine can be deployed in a single container or scaled out to handle load:

For most installations a single instance is sufficient however multiple Analyzer Worker services can be spun up to handle heavy load and to reduce analysis time.
