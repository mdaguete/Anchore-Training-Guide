## Feed Synchronization

When the Anchore Engine runs it will begin to synchronize security feed data from the Anchore feed service.

CVE data for Linux distributions such as Alpine, CentOS, Debian, Oracle, Red Hat and Ubuntu will be downloaded. The initial sync may take anywhere from  10 to 60 minutes depending on the speed of your network connection.

### Checking Feed Status

Starting with Anchore Engine version 0.2.0 the status of the feed synchronization can be retrieved through the API and Anchore CLI.

```
anchore-cli system feeds list

```

This command will report list the feeds synchronized by the Anchore engine, last sync time and current record count.

Note: Time is reported as UTC, not local time.

### Manually initiating feed sync

After the initial sync has completed the engine will run an incremental sync at a user defined period, by default every 4 hours. At any time a feed sync can be initiated through the API or CLI.

A sync operation can be manually initiated by running the system feeds sync command however this should not be required under normal operation.

`anchore-cli system feeds sync`

### Performing full resync

The Anchore Engine can be instructed to flush the current feed data and perform a full synchronization.

Under normal circumstances this operation should not be required since the Anchore Engine performs regular incremental sync.

This process may take anywhere from  10 to 60 minutes depending on the speed of your network connection.

`anchore-cli system feeds sync --flush`

The CLI will issue a warning and prompt for confirmation before proceeding with a sync.
