## Network Proxies

As covered in the Network sections of the requirements document the Anchore Engine requires three categories of network connectivity. 

- Registry Access
  Network connectivity, including DNS resolution, to the registries from which the Anchore Engine needs to download images.

- Feed Service
  The Anchore Engine synchronizes feed data such as operating system vulnerabilities (CVEs) from the Anchore Cloud Service. Only a single end point is required for this synchronization, host: ancho.re TCP port: 443

- Access to Anchore Internal Services
  The Anchore Engine is comprised of six smaller micro-services that can be deployed in a single container or scaled out to handle load. Each Anchore service should be able to connect the other services over the network.

In environments were access to the public internet is restricted then a proxy server may be required to allow the Anchore Engine to connect to the Anchore Cloud Feed Service or to a publicly hosted container registry.

The Anchore Engine can be configured to access a proxy server by using environment variables that are read by the Anchore Engine at run time.

- https_proxy:
  Address of the proxy service to use for HTTPS traffic in the following form: {PROTOCOL}://{IP or HOSTNAME}:{PORT}
  eg. https://proxy.corp.example.com:8128

- http_proxy:    
  Address of the proxy service to use for HTTP traffic in the following form: {PROTOCOL}://{IP or HOSTNAME}:{PORT}   
  eg. http://proxy.corp.example.com:8128

- no_proxy:   
  Comma delimited list of hostnames or IP address which should be accessed directly without using the proxy service.
  eg. localhost,127.0.0.1,registry,example.com

### Notes:

- Do not use double quotes (") around the proxy variable values. 

### Authentication

For proxy servers that require authentication the username and password can be provided as part of the URL:

eg. https_proxy=https://user:password@proxy.corp.example.com:8128

If the username or password contains and non-url safe characters then these should be urlencoded.

For example:

`The password F@oBar! would be encoded as F%40oBar%21`

### Setting Environment Variables

### Deployment Architecture Notes

When setting up a network proxy, keep in mind that you will need to explicitly allow inter-service communication within the anchore engine deployment to bypass the proxy, and potentially other hostnames as well (e.g. internal registries) to ensure that traffic is directed correctly.  In general, all anchore engine service endpoints (the URLs for enabled services in the output of an 'anchore-cli system status' command) as well as any internal registries (the hostnames you may have set up with 'anchore-cli registry add <hostname> ...' or as part of an un-credentialed image add 'anchore-cli image add <registry:port>/....'), should not be proxied (i.e. added to the no_proxy list, as described above).

If you wish to tune this further, below is a list of each component that makes an external URL fetch for various purposes:

- catalog: makes connections to image registries (any host added via 'anchore-cli registry add' or directly via 'anchore-cli image add')
- analyzer: same as catalog
- policy_engine: by default, makes HTTPS connection to https://ancho.re feed service, unless on-prem feed service is deployed
